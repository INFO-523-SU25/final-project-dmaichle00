## Abstract

Add project abstract here.
This project was designed to investigate the DVOA performance stat utilized to quantify performance in the NFL
 and see if there is a link between the season DVOA averages for a team vs. their scores in weekly matchups.
 In addition, I added additional metrics such as how many days of rest each team is on along with indoor vs.
  outdoor venue and game service to create a ridge regression model with the goal of predicting scores.
