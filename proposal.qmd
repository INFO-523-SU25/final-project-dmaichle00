## Dataset

```

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.
What is the correlation of stats such as DVOA and winning percentage
Can I create an algorithm that can predict predict the NFL matchups based on training data?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
My dataset will contain these matchups and I can run a correlation matrix to see what the correlation is between these variables.
To answer the second question, I can feed an algorith with data with team identifiers, performance metrics such as offensive and defense
 DOVA, rest days (if I can find the metrics), and winning percentage (to that point in the season), for each team in the matchup.
I will also have points scored for each team and divide my dataset into training and test sets. From there I can use a model such as
random tree to predict winners for each matchup.
