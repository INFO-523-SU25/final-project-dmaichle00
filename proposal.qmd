This dataset was pulled from the nfl_data_py library. I pulled game data for the 272 games in the 2024 regular season.
This base data contains a game identifer, home and away teams, and scores for both teams. In addition, I generated DVOA for all teams
and applied a column displaying the DVOA of each team along with the differential (home dvoa - away). DVOA is a well known proprietary
metric stemming from ftn fantasy that factors in performance from each snap

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.
What is the correlation of stats such as DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average) and scores within my 2024 dataset?
Can I create an algorithm that can predict predict the NFL matchups based on training data?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
My dataset will contain these matchups and I can run a correlation matrix to see what the correlation is between these variables.
For the first question, I can run a correlation matrix and use python tools to provide a correlation of my target features
To answer the second question, I can feed an algorith with data with team identifiers, performance metrics such as DVOA
 DOVA, rest days (if I can find the metrics), and winning percentage (to that point in the season), for each team in the matchup.
I will also have points scored for each team and divide my dataset into training and test sets. From there I can use a model such as
random tree to predict winners for each matchup. If I have time, I would like to see if I can find a way to add more data columns such
as how many days of rest a team is on to see if I can improve predicatability
